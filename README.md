# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ahmad Ali!

I'm diving deep into **Machine Learning** and using this space to share my journey, projects, and experiments.

---

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Focused On

- **Learning ML Algorithms**: From **Linear Regression** to more advanced models.
- **Building Projects**: Applying Machine Learning to real-world datasets.
- **Improving Every Day**: Understanding the math behind each algorithm and coding them from scratch.

---

### ðŸ›  Tools I Use

- **Python**: My go-to language for Machine Learning.
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Scikit-learn** for machine learning.
  - **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling.
  - **Matplotlib** for plotting data.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Some of My Projects

- **Custom Linear Regression**: I built a custom linear regression model and applied it to the **Diabetes dataset**.
- **Gradient Descent**: Tried out **Batch, Mini-Batch**, and **Stochastic Gradient Descent** on different datasets.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Explored how polynomial regression works with real data.

  Yes it look like kid projects in Machine learning ðŸ˜„! But little bit imporving myself
  So I can build fansy Projects

### ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning Next

- **Neural Networks**: Iâ€™ll soon start learning how to build neural networks.
- **Optimization**: Improving models by tuning parameters and regularization techniques.
- **More Projects**: Keep an eye out for new datasets and solutions!
